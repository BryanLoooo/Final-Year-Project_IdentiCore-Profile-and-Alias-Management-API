  <h3 class="faqHeaders">What is IdentiCore?</h3>
  <p class="p">
    IdentiCore is a modern web platform that allows users to securely manage multiple online identities and aliases in one place. Whether you're a freelancer juggling personal and professional accounts, a privacy-conscious user, or someone who maintains different personas across platforms (e.g., GitHub, LinkedIn, Reddit), IdentiCore helps organize, tag, and control them efficiently.
  </p>
  <p class="p">
    It serves as a central dashboard for visibility control, tag-based grouping, and alias metadata. The platform supports features like reminders, profile editing, context tagging (e.g., “anonymous”, “work”, “fun”), and alias visibility toggles for managing exposure.
  </p><br />
  <h3 class="faqHeaders">Is my data secure?</h3>
  <p class="p">
    Yes, IdentiCore is built with a strong focus on data privacy and security. Sensitive information is encrypted in transit using HTTPS and would be stored securely using encryption-at-rest best practices in a production environment. For authentication, passwords are hashed using bcrypt, ensuring that even if database access is compromised, raw passwords are never exposed.
  </p>
  <p class="p">
    While the demo version may not include all production-grade security layers, the architecture is designed to integrate secure authentication tokens (like JWT), protect against CSRF/XSS vulnerabilities, and store no plain-text credentials. Future releases aim to include Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), role-based access controls, and enhanced audit trails.
  </p><br />
  <h3 class="faqHeaders">Can I update or delete my account?</h3>
  <p class="p">
    Absolutely. IdentiCore gives you full control over your user data. You can:
    <ul class="p">
      <li>Edit your profile details such as username, age, email, and address from the <strong>Settings</strong> page.</li>
      <li>Adjust your reminder preferences for managing aliases.</li>
      <li>Permanently delete your account and all associated data using the <strong>“Danger Zone”</strong> option.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="faqDescription">Please note that deletion is irreversible. Once you delete your account, all stored aliases, tags, and reminders will be permanently erased from the database.</p>
  </p><br />
  <h3 class="faqHeaders">What if I forget my login credentials?</h3>
  <p class="p">
    In the current version of IdentiCore, basic email-password authentication is used. If you forget your credentials, there's no automated recovery system yet. You would need to contact the administrator or re-register.
  </p>
  <p class="p">
    However, a future update will introduce full password reset functionality via email with secure token validation. We also plan to support OAuth login options (e.g., Google Sign-In, GitHub) to make credential management easier.
  </p><br />
  <h3 class="faqHeaders">What types of aliases can I create?</h3>
  <p class="p">
    You can create aliases for any online identity you manage — personal accounts, work profiles, anonymous personas, or project-specific handles. Each alias can be tagged with platforms (like Reddit, GitHub, TikTok) and contexts (e.g., casual, professional) and marked as <em>public</em> or <em>private</em> depending on visibility.
  </p>
  <p class="p">
    These aliases are displayed in your dashboard, grouped and filterable by tags, making it easy to manage many identities without confusion.
  </p><br />
  <h3 class="faqHeaders">Will IdentiCore remain free?</h3>
  <p class="p">
    The current version of IdentiCore is free to use and intended for personal or educational purposes. In the future, a tiered system may be introduced:
    <ul class="p">
      <li><strong>Free Tier</strong>: Basic alias management, profile controls, and reminders.</li>
      <li><strong>Pro Tier</strong>: Advanced analytics, additional storage, data export, and integrations.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="faqDescription">Any changes in pricing will be communicated clearly ahead of time. Your feedback will help shape future plans.</p>
